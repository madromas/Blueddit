# Blueddit

This is ongoing a course project for **`COSC360 - Web Programming`**

## Description
Blueddit serves to be online discussion platform where users can share content such as text posts, links, and images, and participate in discussions on a wide variety of topics, similar to Reddit. Users can browse different categories of content posts, and each content category will be called as a `Tag`(may change the name after).

### Permissions and Access
**Registered users**: Registered users can `post`, `edit` and `commit` posts and browse through contents on the `front page`. Users can access the `profile page` customize their profile and page settings.

**Anonymous users**: Anonymous users can only access the `front pag` and browse other user's posts. Any intention of posting, commenting and clicking the setting/profile tab will direct user to the `registration page`.
