## Description

Blueddit serves as an online discussion platform where users can share content such as text posts, links, and images, and participate in discussions on a wide variety of topics, similar to Reddit. Users can browse different categories of content posts, and each community in each category is referred to as a `Sublueddit`.


### Permissions and Access

**Registered users**: Registered users have the ability to `post`, `edit`, and `comment` on posts and browse content on the `front page`. They also have access to their `profile page`, where they can customize their profile and page settings.

**Guest users**: Guest users can only access the `front page` and browse other users' posts. Any attempt to post, comment, or access the settings/profile tab will direct the user to the `registration page`.

**Moderators/admins**: Moderators have the ability to `edit`, `delete`, and `ban` users. They also have access to the `moderation page`, where they can manage the content of the website.
