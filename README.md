# Blueddit

This is a ongoing course project for **`COSC360 - Web Programming`**

Webpage designs on Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/GZYqqk1sMZQ3e82bNPe0B5/Blueddit?node-id=0%3A1&t=lmrhMjvuA7q9unWG-1

## Description
Blueddit serves as an online discussion platform where users can share content such as text posts, links, and images, and participate in discussions on a wide variety of topics, similar to Reddit. Users can browse different categories of content posts, and each community in each category is referred to as a `Bubble` (the name may change in the future).

### Permissions and Access
**Registered users**: Registered users have the ability to `post`, `edit`, and `comment` on posts and browse content on the `front page`. They also have access to their `profile page`, where they can customize their profile and page settings.

**Anonymous users**: Anonymous users can only access the `front page` and browse other users' posts. Any attempt to post, comment, or access the settings/profile tab will direct the user to the `registration page`.



## Upcoming features

#### Basic functionalities

- **Feed Page**: Display a collection of posts that are curated or posted recently on the forum. The page can be divided into sections and refresh dynamically. Contents on this page should only provide titles of the posts, each with a short preview of post description (2-3 lines) and a post image if exists.
- **Post Page**: Display a single post, along with its details, such as the author, date, and time of creation, number of upvotes and downvotes, and comments. Registered users can add comments to the post, while anonymous users can only view the post and its details.
- **Profile Tab**: Display information about a registered user, such as their name, avatar, number of posts, and comments. Registered users can access their own profile and edit their information, while anonymous users can view the profiles of registered users.
- **Tab Bar with Sections**:Implement a tab bar or navigation menu to allow users to quickly access different sections of the website, such as the feed page, categories, user profiles, etc.
- **Authentication**: Allow users to create an account and log in to the website to post stories and make comments.
- **Create Post**: Allow registered users to create posts with a title, description, and optional images or videos.

- **User Profiles**: Provide user profiles where users can manage their account information and view their activity on the website.
- **Search Function**: Provide a search bar or search options to allow users to search for posts based on keywords or categories.
- **Categories**: Implement categories to categorize posts and make it easier for users to find relevant content.

#### Advanced functionalities
