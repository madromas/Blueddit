## Functional Requirements

Basic functionalities:
- **Feed Page**: Display a collection of posts that are curated or posted recently on the forum. The page can be divided into sections and refresh dynamically. Contents on this page should only provide titles of the posts, each with a short preview of post description (2-3 lines) and a post image if exists.
- **Post Page**: Display a single post, along with its details, such as the author, date, and time of creation, number of upvotes and downvotes, and comments. Registered users can add comments to the post, while anonymous users can only view the post and its details.
- **Profile Tab**: Display information about a registered user, such as their name, avatar, number of posts, and comments. Registered users can access their own profile and edit their information, while anonymous users can view the profiles of registered users.
- **Tab Bar with Sections**:Implement a tab bar or navigation menu to allow users to quickly access different sections of the website, such as the feed page, categories, user profiles, etc.
- **Authentication**: Allow users to create an account and log in to the website to post stories and make comments.
- **Create Post**: Allow registered users to create posts with a title, description, and optional images or videos.
- **Comment Section**: Allow users to add comments to posts, and reply to other comments.
- **User Profiles**: Provide user profiles where users can manage their account information and view their activity on the website.
- **Search Function**: Provide a search bar or search options to allow users to search for posts based on keywords or categories.
- **Categories**: Implement categories to categorize posts and make it easier for users to find relevant content.
